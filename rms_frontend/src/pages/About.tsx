    <p className="about-description">
      Outside of our main product, the title insurance policy, we also offer closing and escrow services, as well as other title-related services. 
      We help protect the rights of both residential and commercial property owners against unexpected legal and financial claims that may arise after closing.
      Coverages can vary by state or locality, but our nationwide expertise can handle them all.
      This expertise allows us to help lenders, builders, developers, attorneys, and real estate professionals grow and succeed.
      We are also a provider of annuity and life insurance products, providing deferred annuities, including fixed index annuities, fixed rate annuities, and immediate annuities and indexed universal life insurance through our wholly-owned subsidiary, FGL Holdings ("F&G").
